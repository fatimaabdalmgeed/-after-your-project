## üîñ Project Title & Description

**Project Title:** AI-Assisted Developer Toolkit (AIDevKit)

**Short Description:**  
AIDevKit is a developer-focused project scaffold and workflow assistant that uses AI to accelerate feature scaffolding, testing, documentation, and context-aware code maintenance. It is designed for individual developers and small teams building web and API services who want to safely integrate AI to automate routine development tasks while retaining control over code quality.

**Who it's for:**  
- Backend and full-stack developers looking to speed up feature scaffolding.  
- Small engineering teams wanting consistent documentation and test coverage.  
- DevOps engineers who want AI-assisted CI/CD suggestions.  
- Open-source maintainers who want to automate contributor onboarding docs and issue templates.

**Why it matters:**  
AI can remove repetitive development overhead (boilerplate, tests, docs) so developers can focus on core design and problem solving. With careful integration, AIDevKit boosts productivity without sacrificing code quality or security.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python (backend utilities), JavaScript/TypeScript (frontend helpers), Bash (scripts)  
- **Frameworks & Tools:**  
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints and scaffolding services  
  - Frontend: React + Vite (optional UI dashboard)  
  - Database: SQLite (local dev), PostgreSQL (production)  
  - Testing: pytest, Playwright (end-to-end)  
  - Linting & Formatting: Black, Flake8, ESLint, Prettier  
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions  
  - CLI: Click (Python) or oclif/commander (Node) for CLI helpers  
  - GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repository automation
- **AI & ML Tools:** OpenAI API (or equivalent LLM provider), local embedding store (Weaviate/FAISS) for context retrieval, LangChain-style orchestration (optional).

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

AIDevKit uses AI in focused, auditable ways across the development lifecycle.

### 1. Code generation (scaffolding & feature templates)
- **What:** Generate feature scaffolds (API endpoints, DB models, tests) from high-level prompts or templates.
- **How:**  
  - Developers provide a feature spec (YAML or prompt). An IDE plugin or CLI agent calls the LLM to produce:
    - route handler code (FastAPI)  
    - data models / Pydantic schemas  
    - initial unit tests (pytest)  
    - example API docs (OpenAPI snippets)  
  - Generated code is placed in a feature branch for review.
- **Safeguards:**  
  - Use deterministic seeds or temperature=0 for repeatable scaffolds.  
  - Run static analysis and linters automatically.  
  - Require human PR review before merging.

### 2. Testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- **What:** AI-assisted test generation, test refactoring, and test case suggestion.
- **How:**  
  - Provide API specs, example inputs/outputs, and code under test to the model to synthesize unit tests.  
  - Use prompt templates that ask the model to follow Arrange-Act-Assert patterns and include edge cases.  
  - Tooling: pytest for unit tests, pytest-asyncio for async code, Playwright for browser e2e.
- **Prompts & Tools:**  
  - Maintain a library of test-generation prompts (e.g., "Given this FastAPI schema and function, produce pytest tests that assert success and common failure modes").  
  - Automatically run generated tests in CI; failures block PRs.

### 3. Documentation (docstrings, inline comments, README)
- **What:** Auto-generate and maintain documentation from code and API specs.
- **How:**  
  - Use model to create concise docstrings for functions, classes, and complex blocks using the surrounding code as context.  
  - Generate or update top-level README sections when features change.  
  - Create CHANGELOG entries from commit diffs using a "Keep a Changelog" style prompt.
- **Workflow:**  
  - On PR creation, run an "AI doc job" that suggests docstring updates and a proposed README diff.  
  - Developers review and accept doc edits during code review.

### 4. Context-aware techniques
- **What:** Improve model responses by providing relevant context: API specs, file trees, code diffs, and recent commits.
- **How:**  
  - Build a context retriever that:
    - Indexes project files and API specs into an embedding store.  
    - For each prompt, includes the most relevant files, function definitions, or git diffs (summarized) before sending to the model.  
  - Use "chain-of-thought" style prompts only internally; avoid leaking in outputs.
- **Examples:**  
  - When generating tests for `users.py`, feed the LLM the `users.py` file, `schemas.py`, and recent commit message that modified user registration logic.
  - When updating docs, feed the README, API OpenAPI spec, and file list to ensure consistency.

## üîí Safety, Privacy & Governance

- **Data minimization:** Never send user secrets (API keys, passwords, PII) to the LLM. Strip secrets before creating prompts.  
- **Audit logs:** Keep logs of model inputs and outputs tied to PRs (encrypted at rest).  
- **Human-in-the-loop:** All generated code must be reviewed by a human maintainer before merge.  
- **Licensing & IP:** Clearly document license expectations for generated code; default to permissive license (MIT) unless organization policy dictates otherwise.

---

## üîÅ CI/CD & Automation

- **CI Jobs:**  
  - `lint` ‚Äî run Black, Flake8, ESLint, Prettier  
  - `test` ‚Äî run pytest and Playwright tests  
  - `ai-docs` ‚Äî run the AI doc job and produce suggested diffs as PR comments  
  - `security` ‚Äî run bandit, safety, or Snyk for dependency checks
- **Automation with GH CLI:** Example:
```bash
# create a repo and push current directory
gh repo create ORG/REPO_NAME --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
